## Introduction

This reflection documents my journey of expanding my single-page portfolio into a comprehensive multi-page website using Quarto and Large Language Models (LLMs). The process has been both challenging and enlightening, offering valuable insights into the effective use of AI tools for content creation while maintaining authenticity and accuracy.

## Evolution of My LLM Usage

### What Worked Better with Multi-Page Development

**More Specific Prompting**: As I expanded to multiple pages, I found that providing more structured and specific prompts to the LLM yielded significantly better results. Rather than asking for general content for an entire site, breaking down requests by page type and specific sections allowed for more tailored and relevant outputs.

**Iterative Refinement**: The multi-page approach enabled a more iterative process with the LLM. I could focus on refining one page at a time, providing feedback on generated content, and requesting specific adjustments. This iterative dialogue with the LLM produced progressively better content that more accurately reflected my experience and voice.

**Template-Based Approach**: I discovered that having the LLM generate structural templates for each page type first, then filling in specific content in subsequent interactions, created more consistent and well-organized pages. This approach helped maintain a cohesive design language across the entire site while allowing for page-specific customization.

**Content Integration**: The multi-page format allowed me to better integrate related content across pages through internal linking and consistent terminology. I could prompt the LLM to suggest natural connection points between pages, creating a more cohesive user experience.

## Ensuring Authenticity and Accuracy

Maintaining the authenticity and accuracy of my portfolio was paramount throughout this process. Here's how I approached this challenge:

**Fact-Checking and Verification**: For every piece of content generated by the LLM, I meticulously reviewed and verified all factual information against my actual experience and qualifications. This included dates, job responsibilities, project outcomes, and skill levels.

**Voice and Tone Consistency**: I provided the LLM with examples of my writing style and repeatedly emphasized the importance of maintaining a consistent professional voice that authentically represented me. When generated content didn't align with my natural communication style, I requested specific adjustments.

**Balancing AI Assistance with Personal Input**: While the LLM was invaluable for generating structure and suggesting content approaches, I made sure to heavily edit and personalize all content. This ensured that the final portfolio accurately reflected my unique experiences and perspective rather than generic professional language.

**Contextual Accuracy**: I paid special attention to ensuring that all content was contextually accurate to my specific industry and geographic experience. This sometimes required correcting LLM-generated content that made assumptions based on more general professional contexts rather than my specific experience in Ghana and Canada.

## Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge**: The LLM occasionally generated overly ambitious or exaggerated claims about project outcomes or skill levels.

**Solution**: I established clear guidelines for quantifiable achievements, only including metrics I could substantiate, and adjusted skill level descriptions to accurately reflect my capabilities.

**Challenge**: Maintaining consistency across multiple pages generated in different sessions.

**Solution**: I created a style guide document that I referenced in prompts to the LLM, ensuring consistent terminology, formatting, and tone across all pages.

**Challenge**: The LLM sometimes struggled with the technical aspects of Quarto formatting.

**Solution**: I learned to request content in a more basic format first, then manually applied the appropriate Quarto-specific formatting and features.

## Lessons Learned

This process has taught me several valuable lessons about effectively working with LLMs:

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Establishing clear boundaries between AI assistance and personal input is essential for maintaining authenticity.

2. **Specific Guidance**: The more specific and structured the prompts, the more useful and accurate the LLM's output.

3. **Critical Evaluation**: Always approach LLM-generated content with a critical eye, particularly regarding factual claims and personal representation.

4. **Iterative Process**: The most effective approach is iterative, with multiple rounds of generation, feedback, and refinement.

5. **Technical Limitations**: Understanding the technical limitations of LLMs helps set realistic expectations and develop appropriate workflows.

## Conclusion

Expanding my portfolio into a multi-page website with the assistance of LLMs has been a valuable learning experience. The process has not only resulted in a more comprehensive and professional online presence but has also deepened my understanding of how to effectively leverage AI tools while maintaining authenticity and accuracy.

As AI tools continue to evolve, I believe the key to their effective use lies in viewing them as collaborative assistants rather than autonomous creators. By maintaining a clear vision of my goals and identity, providing specific guidance, and critically evaluating all generated content, I was able to create a portfolio that authentically represents my professional journey while benefiting from the efficiency and creative suggestions that LLMs can provide.

Moving forward, I plan to continue refining my approach to working with LLMs, focusing on even more specific prompting strategies and developing more structured workflows for content creation and verification.
