My early professional experiences at the Forestry Commission and Registrar General Department in Ghana provided practical insights into public sector financial management and regulatory compliance.\nThe pivotal moment in my career came when I joined Guinness Ghana Brewery PLC (Diageo) as a Trade Promoter. This role exposed me to the dynamic world of consumer goods marketing and sales strategy, teaching me valuable lessons about market dynamics, consumer behavior, and strategic positioning.\nMy subsequent roles in sales management at Ataa Maame Enterprise and financial consulting with PwC further expanded my expertise, allowing me to develop comprehensive skills in financial analysis, strategic planning, and operational management."
